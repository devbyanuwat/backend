# Express.js Docker Container

This repository contains a Docker configuration for running an Express.js project in a container.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed on your system:

- Docker: [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- Node.js: [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

## Project Details

### Project Dependencies

The Express.js project has the following dependencies, which are listed in the `package.json` file:

- cors: ^2.8.5
- express: ^4.18.2
- mysql2: ^3.6.2
- nodemon: ^3.0.1

### Package.json

Here is an overview of the key details in the `package.json` file:

- **name:** backend
- **version:** 1.0.0
- **main:** index.js
- **scripts:**
  - **test:** Runs tests if available.
  - **start:** Starts the application using `node index`.
  - **nodemon:** Starts the application with nodemon for automatic code reloading during development.
- **author:** (Your name or author information)
- **license:** ISC (You can specify your project's license here)
- **description:** (A brief description of your project)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the Express.js project in a Docker container:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd express-docker-project
   ```

3. Install project dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Build the Docker image:

   ```bash
   docker build -t express-docker .
   ```

5. Run the Docker container:

   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 4001:4001 express-docker
   ```

The application should now be running inside a Docker container, and you can access it at [http://localhost:4001](http://localhost:4001).

## Configuration

The Express.js application runs on port 4001 by default. You can change the port by modifying the `PORT` constant in the `app.js` file.

## Stopping and Cleaning Up

To stop and remove the Docker container, use the following commands:

```bash
docker stop $(docker ps -a -q --filter ancestor=express-docker --format="{{.ID}}")
docker rm $(docker ps -a -q --filter ancestor=express-docker --format="{{.ID}}")
```
